Player agency is important when losing something in their possession:
	e.g. On loss: You opponent wants one of these three cards. Pick one to give up.
Player onboarding issue. Lots of information up from
	Basic tutorial to see fusions, attacking, passing
	tutorial board -> fuse card in play, fuse card to card, fuse card to opponent, attack creature, attack opponent, pass turn
Aaron wants fusion showcase/guide to display outcome/results of fusion
	Guide book that shows previous fusions
		Non-basic cards appear as unknown in guide book until they are fused into
		Shows incoming and outgoing fusions when discovered
			e.g. 	|F1+B1|				+ |F1|		-->> Roaring Gorilla
				|F2+B1|		-->> Phoenix	+ |F2|		-->> Roaring Gorilla
				|F1+B2|				+ |F3|		-->> Magmacloak Draco
				|F2+B2|				+ |W1|		-->> Undersea Vents
	"Break in case of fusion emergency" button - Allows each player once per game after a fusion but before attacking, to fuse a single card to the slot previously fused to. Lets player choose two activate in order to save an unfinished fusion or save them from an accidental bump.
Liked 100-1 ranking system where you can fight anyone including the final boss any time
Focus on single player
